# CreditCardFraud-Detection
Developed a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions using logistic regression.
Utilized a dataset with features including transaction time, amount, and anonymized features derived from PCA for training the model.
Performed data preprocessing, splitting the dataset into training and test sets to evaluate model performance.
Achieved a training accuracy of 94.7% and a test accuracy of 94.4% by fine-tuning the model.
Applied performance metrics such as accuracy to assess the detection capability on unseen data.
